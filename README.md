The seller can, via the profile, upload book offers for buyers to find. A buyer can search for books using various filters such as: price, academic year, author, etc. The buyer contacts seller(s) for purchase by accessing the seller's profile associated to each offer. An admin has access to the amount of profiles and offers on the application. Additionally, admins have the authority to remove irrelevant profiles/offers.
